english word list by grade
English word lists vary based on whether you are looking for high-frequency sight words, academic vocabulary, or spelling lists. 
Primary Grade Word Lists (K-5)
For early learners, focus is typically on Dolch or Fry sight words—the most common words in English literature. 
Kindergarten: Focus on 50–100 basic sight words like a, the, in, up, go, see.
1st Grade: Introduces simple 3-4 letter words and 100 high-frequency words such as all, each, many, then.
2nd Grade: Transitions to basic academic words and "tricky" words like because, through, animal, house.
3rd–5th Grade: Shifts toward "Tier 2" academic vocabulary—words used across subjects but rarely in casual speech—such as additional, obvious, confirm, investigate, and debris. 
Middle & High School Word Lists (6-12)
Curricula at this level prioritize words found in classic literature and standardized tests like the SAT/ACT. 
Middle School (6-8): Focuses on words that denote precision, like colossal, discipline, meticulous, and remnant.
High School (9-12): Moves into advanced, nuanced vocabulary for professional and literary contexts, including abjure, evanescent, frugal, longevity, and conundrum. 
Recommended Resources by Grade
Vocabulary.com Lists by Grade: Offers curated lists for every grade level from 1st through 12th, often based on common textbooks.
GreatSchools Vocabulary Word Lists: Provides age-appropriate "big" words for each grade.
Flocabulary "Word Up" Project: Categorizes core vocabulary into color-coded levels for Kindergarten through 8th Grade.
SpellQuiz Printable Lists: Specifically targets spelling proficiency for grades 1–12. 
Are you looking for a specific grade level or a particular type of word list (e.g., spelling vs. reading)?

Japan lists kanji by grade they are taught. I am looking for the equivalent for English, preferably USA. please give me a list of words separated by grade
Unlike Japan’s Kyōiku Kanji, which are regulated by the Ministry of Education, the United States has no single "official" federal word list. Instead, vocabulary is divided into sight words (reading fluency), spelling lists, and academic vocabulary (subject-based), which vary by state and curriculum. 
Below are the most widely recognized US standards for grade-level vocabulary:
1. Sight Words (Grades K–3) 
These lists, such as the Dolch Word List, focus on high-frequency words that children should recognize by sight to achieve reading fluency. 
Kindergarten: a, and, away, big, blue, can, come, down, find, for, funny, go, help, here, I, in, is, it, jump, little, look, make, me, my, not, one, play, red, run, said, see, the, three, to, two, up, we, where, yellow, you.
1st Grade: after, again, an, any, as, ask, by, could, every, fly, from, give, going, had, has, her, him, his, how, just, know, let, live, may, of, old, once, open, over, put, round, some, stop, take, thank, them, then, think, walk, were, when.
2nd Grade: always, around, because, been, before, best, both, buy, call, cold, does, don't, fast, first, five, found, gave, goes, green, its, made, many, off, or, pull, read, right, sing, sit, sleep, tell, their, these, those, upon, us, use, very, wash, which, why, wish, work, would, write, your.
3rd Grade: about, better, bring, carry, clean, cut, done, draw, drink, eight, fall, far, full, got, grow, hold, hot, if, keep, kind, laugh, light, long, much, myself, never, only, own, pick, seven, shall, show, six, small, start, ten, today, together, try, warm. 
2. Middle School Academic Vocabulary (Grades 6–8)
At this stage, lists shift toward Tier 2 words—general academic terms used across different subjects like science and history. 
6th Grade: accurate, analyze, contrast, evaluate, factor, identify, interpret, occur, respond, structure.
7th Grade: abbreviate, conspicuous, detest, frugal, hilarity, meticulous, reprehensible, stagnate, succumb.
8th Grade: absolve, bamboozle, crucial, dispatch, fallacy, inevitable, onslaught, rebuff, strident. 
3. High School & SAT/ACT Preparation (Grades 9–12)
High school lists focus on complex, nuanced words for advanced reading and college entrance exams. 
9th–10th Grade: aberration, brevity, camaraderie, delineate, ephemeral, frugal, iconoclast, juxtaposition, longevity, narcissist.
11th–12th Grade: abjure, anathema, circumnavigate, deleterious, enigma, immutable, interminable, metamorphosis, paradigm, revere, synopsis, ubiquitous. 
Where to Find Full Lists
For Schools: The Flocabulary "Word Up" Project provides research-based academic lists for Grades K–8.
For State Standards: The Texas Education Agency (TEA) and Berkeley Unified School District offer comprehensive high-frequency and academic lists used in public schools.

OAR413-215-0000 adoption agency, anyone who makes decisions of best interest or reasonable efforts is defined by Oregon administrative rules as an adoption agency 
  So the whole juvenile court, CPS and DHS (department of human services) and the Judges who drop the gavle issuing the order to take people's children, and terminating parental rights. 
   They say if the parents receive any money at all from the adoption "fee" which goes to pay for costs incurred like attorneys fees, court fees for termination of parental rights. 
   yes, they sell the children, and use the money to pay themselves for terminating the parents' rights. Fortunately for us parents, we are not committing child trafficking by selling our children because we don't see a penny of the adoption fee.
Instead, young unsuspecting poor mothers are encouraged to seek help from DHS so they go and apply for Title IV E funding from DHS. More commonly known now as FAREWELL oops, I'm dyslexic.. welfare This qualifies the young unsuspecting mother to receive some Laundry money, about$ 10,000.. in total from "temporary assistance for needy families"  the needy part is what qualifies you for the CPS hit list. When you run out of TANF, they are coming for your children. All of them.
  Every single welfare mom I've ever known has had their children taken for at least 6 months, most for 2 years or more.
. 3 years of payments, then they make an excuse, take your child hold them hostage temporary assistance for needy families is advanced cash payment for your child. 
   Look it up in the Oregon administrative rules, the "Child Farewell" program of DHS is just one state owned and operated corporations under "umbrella" rules protecting them to do criminal things like, it's legal for DHS to record children having sex as long as it is during an ongoing investigation, or for educational purposes.. educational purposes? That's just straight up child porn! WTF?!? 
  So this state corporate power run by government policy that the state dictates in order to get the "best interest" rate of cash return for children by selling them for adoption.. you will never hear a judge say "well, the best interest of this child is with their parents". 
   In 2016 Judge Tripp ordered CPS to " PUT THOSE CHILDREN BACK WHERE THEY BELONG, WITH THEIR FATHER! AND CLOSED THE CASE " WITH PREJUDICE ". CANT BE REOPENED.. 
  SAME WAY Judge BROYLES ORDERED MOMS' CASE " CLOSED WITH PREJUDICE " IN 2011
THIS IS A WARNING DO NOT APPLY FOR TANF. IT IS FAREWELL MONEY ITS BAIT WHILE THEY DO THE PAPERWORK AND USE YOU TO LAUNDER THE MONEY. EVERY VISIT AT DHS HARMS YOUR CHILD. IT IS TRAUMA TO GET JUST A FEW MINUTES WITH YOUR PEOPLE AND BE DRAGGED AWAY AGAIN AND AGAIN. they do this with visits in order to damage your bond with your child. After a while, the excitement wears off, you don't want to go visit cause you only feel worse afterwards.. that is how you prepare a child for a" trauma bond".
